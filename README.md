# PokemonAPI

This project is about ingesting the [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/) API and answers the following questions:

1. How many Pokemon has "at" and two "a" in their names?

2. How many species a pokemon can procreate?

3. What is the maximum and minimum weight of pokemons belonging to a certain group of pokemons filtered by its type and id.

In the [main](main.py) file there are the three functions that answer each questions. The function called `count_filter_names()` answer the first question. The function `how_many_species_can_procreate()` answers the second question and `get_max_min_weight()` the third one.

I used python 3.10.2 version.
